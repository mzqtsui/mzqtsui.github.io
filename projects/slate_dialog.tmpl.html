        This was my major project when I worked at Christie Digital. Slate is a multiplayer Unity game mapped on a tetrahedral (read: trianglular pyramid) with three projectors. I made a capture-the-flag mode with various mechanics including mines, freeze, and shield. You and up to 3 friends each control a small ship with your smartphones.

        Directional controls on the left and points, health, ammo count, and current mechanic on the right. It was Christmas time, so every little present box on the map gave you a completely random mechanic!
